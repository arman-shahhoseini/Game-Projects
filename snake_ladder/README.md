## Snake and Ladder Game 

# Description:
This is a Python implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder game. The game is played on a board with numbered squares, where players move their tokens based on the roll of a dice. The objective is to navigate the token from the starting square to the final square, while encountering snakes and ladders along the way.
Features
Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter
Supports multiple players (2 to 6 players)
Animated token movement on the game board
Snakes and ladders implemented with appropriate rules
Dice roll simulation
Winner announcement
Install the required dependencies (if any) by running the following command:
```python -m pip install random tk time```

# Usage
Run the main.py file to start the game.
Select the number of players from the drop-down menu.
Click the "Start" button to begin the game.
Take turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
The game will automatically move the player's token based on the dice roll and apply the rules for snakes and ladders.
The first player to reach the final square (30) wins the game.
